## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (this project supports Python 3.10-3.14)
- [uv][uv-documentation] for dependency management
- Git for version control

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/56kyle/robust-python-demo.git
   cd robust-python-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**

   ```bash
   uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install
   ```

4. **Verify your setup:**
   ```bash
   uvx nox -l  # List available development tasks
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards (see below)

3. **Test your changes:**

   ```bash
   # Run the full test suite
   uvx nox -s tests-python

   # Run tests for a specific Python version
   uvx nox -s tests-python-314

   # Run a specific test file
   uvx nox -s tests-python -- tests/unit_tests/test_specific.py
   ```

4. **Check code quality:**

   ```bash
   # Format code
   uvx nox -s format-python

   # Lint code
   uvx nox -s lint-python

   # Type check
   uvx nox -s typecheck

   # Security checks
   uvx nox -s security-python

   # Or run all checks at once
   uvx nox -t ci
   ```

5. **Update documentation if needed:**
   ```bash
   # Build docs locally
   uvx nox -s build-docs
   ```

### Coding Standards

This project follows these standards:

- **Code formatting:** [Ruff][ruff-documentation] (automatically applied by pre-commit)
- **Linting:** Ruff with comprehensive rule set
- **Type checking:** [Basedpyright][basedpyright-documentation]
- **Security:** [Bandit][bandit-documentation] for security linting
- **Commit messages:** [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] format preferred
- **Testing:** [pytest][pytest-documentation] with good coverage

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality in the appropriate test directory:
  - `tests/unit_tests/` - Fast, isolated unit tests
  - `tests/integration_tests/` - Tests that involve multiple components
  - `tests/acceptance_tests/` - End-to-end behavior tests
- Aim for good test coverage (check with `uvx nox -s coverage`)
- Use descriptive test names and docstrings
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch** to your fork
2. **Open a pull request** with:

   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description explaining what and why
   - Link to any relevant issues
   - Note any breaking changes

3. **Ensure CI passes** - all automated checks must pass
4. **Respond to review feedback** if requested
5. **Squash commits** if requested before merge

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Update documentation for user-facing changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Follow the existing code style
- Ensure all CI checks pass
